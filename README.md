# rbx-diff-action

Uses [rbx-fileview](https://github.com/Barocena/RBX-Fileview) to create readable yaml diffs for file changes

## Usage

Add this action to your GitHub Actions workflow to generate readable diffs for Roblox files. You can target place files (`.rbxl`, `.rbxlx`), model files (`.rbxm`, `.rbxmx`), or both.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Generate Roblox File Diffs
    uses: NinjaMandalorian/rbx-diff-action@v1.0.1
    with:
      comment: 'true'
      file-types: 'both'
```

Set `comment: 'true'` to post the generated report back to the pull request or issue when the workflow has a valid token and target number.
